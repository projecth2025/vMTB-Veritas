-- ============================================================================
-- Fix MoM/transcript visibility in meeting history + detail.
--
-- Problem (verified live 2026-09-24):
--   * meeting_transcripts.mtb_id is always NULL (proxy never learns the MTB),
--     so get_mtb_transcripts (WHERE mtb_id = p_mtb_id) returned zero rows and
--     the UI always fell through to "No transcript available".
--   * meeting_transcripts.meeting_id is the opaque Jitsi conference UUID —
--     NOT meeting_sessions.id — so the frontend join on session.id never
--     matched even when rows existed.
--
-- Fix:
--   1. Auto-link mtb_id by matching an unlinked transcript's started_at
--      window against that MTB's meeting_sessions (the documented
--      reconciliation approach in docs/JITSI_TRANSCRIPTION_CONFIG.md §5).
--   2. Return session_id (best-matching meeting_sessions.id) so the frontend
--      can join without guessing.
--   3. Gate on owner-or-member (auth.uid()) — the previous RPC leaked any
--      MTB's transcripts to any authenticated caller who guessed the UUID.
--      (Owners are not in mtb_members; only join-code members are.)
